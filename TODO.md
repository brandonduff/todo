### Todo List

- Add the ability to group todos by day
    - This might have an interface like todo set_day will change the
      current day, and then all the normal todo commands are scoped to
      that day.
    - Flag could show todos for the week or month
    - set_day could support relative days, or absolute
        - Maybe will default to current year, so I could do todo set_day 11/7
        - todo set_day monday would be cool too
    - This will be pretty ambitious. Will change how we store the data and all that.
      Doable, though.
